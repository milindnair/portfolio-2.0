          <p className='py-2'>
            I am a third year student pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and
            Engineering from <a href=''><b><u>KJ Somaiya College of Engineering</u></b></a>, Mumbai with
            a honours in Data Science and Analytics. I am currently serving as 
            the <b><u>Joint Technical Head of <a href=''>CSI KJSCE</a></u></b>. Previously, I have worked 
            as an Embedded Systems Programmer at <a href=''>Team KJSCE Robocon</a>.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2'>
            I specialize in <b>full stack</b> mobile responsive front-end applications
            that connect with APIs and other backend technologies. Iâ€™m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>
          <p className='py-2'>
            Apart from being a web developer, I also indulge in developing 
            <b>mobile applications using Flutter and Dart</b>. I am also a deep learning
            enthusiast and have worked on various projects related to computer vision
            and natural language processing.
